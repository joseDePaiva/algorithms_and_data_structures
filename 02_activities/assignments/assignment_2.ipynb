The helper function insertLevelOrder is used to construct the binary tree from an array representation, allowing us to test the bt_path function with different tree structures. The result is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a path from the root to a leaf node.*"

Therefore, the time complexity of the DFS itself is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Additionally, the total time spent on copying paths during this traversal is also bounded by O(n), as each node and edge is processed exactly once, and each path is copied exactly once.*\n",

The recursion stack's depth depends on the height of the tree, leading to a space complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree. Furthermore, since we store all root-to-leaf paths and each path can potentially contain up to O(n) nodes, the total space required for storing these paths is O(n). Therefore, combining both aspects, the overall space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack and the storage of paths.*"

The bt_path function explores each path from the root to the leaves, collecting all such paths. For example, in the tree [1, 2, 3, None, 5], it correctly identifies the paths [1, 2, 5] and [1, 3], while in the tree [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, None, 18], it finds the paths [10, 5, 3], [10, 5, 7], and [10, 15, 18]. The implementation handles these cases well, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). However, for very large trees, it might be beneficial to consider an iterative DFS approach to avoid potential stack overflow issues and to handle edge cases more robustly.*"
